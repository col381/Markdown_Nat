# Introduction
My name is Nathalie Colgrave.  I work in Finance supporting CSIRO Data61. Data School was my introduction to coding.  Prior to Data School, monthly reports were compiled via manipulation in excel through cell referencing as well as usuage of functions such as vlookup.

# My Project
I am working through developing a monthly report to replace the current report.  To date I have been able to create short cuts to steps by coding part of the report.  My aim is to, over time, work towards compiling the whole report via R Studio.  The process to date has improved accuracy due to minimal manual intervention as well as being time effective.

The Data I currently use is financial information downloaded from SAP.  Through coding,  R allows for the manipulation of a tibble frame with 582 observations and 15 variable to extract 10 lines and 2 columns summarising the external revenue and expenditure positions within groups structured under the program.  We are then able to drill down to project level to see what makes up the summary.  The program director can manage at the summary level.  The group and initiative leaders can follow up any financial issues with their project leaders as issues can be identified at project level.  

Using the sum function we are able to establish 

Total Revenue earned to date 
```{sum(Initiative2$YTD_Actual_sum)}```
Total Revenue budgeted for the Financial Year.
```{sum(Initiative2$FY_Plan_sum)}```


The table below is a drill down of the above numbers to  initiative level.  This level is managed by initiative leaders.
```{revopex <- read_csv("Sept.csv")
actual <- revopex %>%
  mutate(Initiative = recode(Cluster_Contact, 
                             `Brent Henderson` = "Environmental & Biological",
                             `Chen Cai`  = "Transport and Logistics",
                             `Gavin Walker` = "Data Science Application",
                             `Lachlan Hetherton` = "Industrial Transformation",
                             `Mahesh Prakash` = "Natural Hazards and Infrastructure",
                             `Zili Zhu` = "Risklab",
                             `Paul Cleary` = "Industrial Device Optimisation",
                             `Simon Harrison` = "Digital Human",
                             `Richard Nock` = "Machine Learning",
                             `Not assigned` = "Initiative to be advised"))%>%
  filter(Initiative!= "")

Initiative2 <- actual%>%
  mutate(Operating = recode(Cost_Element,`Travel` = "Other Operating",`TOTAL REVENUE`="External Revenue"))%>%
  group_by(Initiative,Operating) %>%
  summarise(YTD_Actual_sum = sum(YTD_Actual,na.rm = TRUE),FY_Plan_sum = sum(FY_Plan,na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  filter(Operating %in% c("External Revenue"))}```

The initiative leaders will then refer the project level information to project the
leaders 
```{}```

Group leaders like to see available capacity per staff.
```{}```

Initiative leaders like to see what is actually allocated to their initiative and how that compares to their understanding of capability deployed to their area.
```{}```

Graph below illustrates what we have earned and what we anticipate to sign and deliver by year end.
Our External Revenue Target is 11.4m.  Below shows that we are short of xxm  

In order to build this demo poster correctly, you will also need to have installed the `tidyverse`, 
`gapminder`, and `kableExtra` packages.

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

**Plots from R**
```{r standard-plot, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Yet another gapminder plot"}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1987) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Your figure and table captions are automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text
if needed: see eg. Table \@ref(tab:mytable) and Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot)

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Which ones have you learned since starting 
Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here.

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

What parts of the project took the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

I generally go into any challenge with the attitude of "how hard can this be"

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

Other parts of your Data School experience. 
- Culture - encourages one where you collaborate, pushes you to ask questions and work on your communication skills via slack.

What aspects of the program did you really enjoy?  Feelings towards the program were balanced with frustration and satisfaction.  Extreme highs and lows.  Overall worth while.
I have been analysing and summarising and refining the tidying process almost everyday of the week attempting to improve the compiling, analysing and presentation of financial information.

I have discussed this knowledge with team members.  Team members are generally interested.  There is concern of juggling the program with work and a young family as well as juggling workload between team members whilst participation in the program.
